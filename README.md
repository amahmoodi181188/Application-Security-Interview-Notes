# Application-Security-Interview-Notes

Welcome to my repository! Here, I have compiled all my notes related to Application Security (AppSec) interview question and answer pairs based on my diverse experiences throughout my career journey. I gradually complete this Repo and als oused ChatGpt alot to complete definition, sort out data, add explanation and examples, ... so I can say one of my main references are ChatGpt and for sure share links of any topics if I use in the dedicated file!

**Organization**
**Categorization**: I have categorized the questions to ensure they are easy to navigate. The categories include Android, Web Applications, Headers, and more.
**Details and Links**: To keep the content concise, I have included links to relevant resources instead of providing exhaustive details.
**File Naming**: Files are named according to the type of questions they contain for better organization and easy access.
**Purpose**
I hope these notes will be helpful for anyone preparing for AppSec interviews. Your feedback and questions are welcome.
