### An Overview

Threat modeling is a structured process used to identify, assess, and address potential security threats to a system. The goal is to understand the security risks to the system, prioritize those risks, and develop mitigation strategies to reduce or eliminate them.

### Importance of Threat Modeling

- **Proactive Security**: Identifies potential threats early in the development process.
- **Resource Allocation**: Helps prioritize security efforts based on risk.
- **Improves Communication**: Facilitates better communication about security risks among stakeholders.
- **Compliance**: Assists in meeting regulatory and compliance requirements.

### Methodologies for Threat Modeling

1. **STRIDE**
    - **Description**: STRIDE is a mnemonic for six types of security threats: **Spoofing**, **Tampering**, **Repudiation**, **Information Disclosure**, **Denial of Service**, and **Elevation of Privilege**.
    - **Usage**: It's commonly used for identifying potential threats in a system by examining how each of these threats could manifest. Its categorised as a defensive type of Threat Modelling models!
2. **DREAD**
    - **Description**: DREAD is a risk assessment model that stands for **Damage potential**, **Reproducibility**, **Exploitability**, **Affected users**, and **Discoverability**.
    - **Usage**: Used to rate, compare, and prioritize the severity of different threats.
3. **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**
4. **OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)**
5. **Trike**

### STRIDE: Detailed Explanation

**STRIDE** is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft to help identify and categorize threats. It is an acronym for the following six types of security threats:

1. **Spoofing**:
    - **Description**: Impersonating something or someone else.
    - **Example**: An attacker pretends to be a legitimate user to gain unauthorized access.
2. **Tampering**:
    - **Description**: Modifying data or code.
    - **Example**: An attacker alters a file on disk or changes data in transit over a network.
3. **Repudiation**:
    - **Description**: Claiming not to have performed an action.
    - **Example**: A user denies making a purchase, and there are no logs to prove otherwise.
4. **Information Disclosure**:
    - **Description**: Exposing information to unauthorized entities.
    - **Example**: Sensitive data such as credit card numbers are exposed through improper access control.
5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:
    - **Description**: Making a system unavailable to its intended users.
    - **Example**: An attacker overwhelms a server with requests, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
6. **Elevation of Privilege**:
    - **Description**: Gaining higher privileges than permitted.
    - **Example**: An attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain admin rights on a system.

### Tools for STRIDE

1. **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool**
2. **OWASP Threat Dragon**:
    - **Description**: An open-source threat modeling tool from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
    - **Features**: Easy-to-use interface, support for STRIDE and other threat modeling methodologies, and integration with GitHub for collaborative modeling.
3. **ThreatModeler**:
    - **Description**: An enterprise-level automated threat modeling solution.
    - **Features**: Supports STRIDE, integrates with CI/CD pipelines, and provides real-time threat intelligence.
