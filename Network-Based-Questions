### Tell me anything you know about OSI Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. It is divided into seven layers, each serving a specific function and interacting with the layers directly above and below it.

**The Seven Layers of the OSI Model**

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):** Transmits raw bit stream over a physical medium.
    - **Protocols/Technologies**: Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, RS-232.
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):** Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error correction from the physical layer.
    - **Protocols**: Ethernet, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), MAC (Media Access Control).
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Handles packet forwarding including routing through different routers.
    - **Protocols**: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers.
    - **Protocols**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5):** Manages sessions and controls the dialogues (connections) between computers.
    - **Protocols**: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Translates data between the application layer and the network format, and vice versa.
    - **Protocols/Formats**: SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), JPEG, MPEG.
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: Provides network services directly to applications.
    - **Protocols**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System).

### Explain […] Protocol

here they ask you please explain for example TCP protocol. So I list some famous protocols and ports and its function:

**1- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite (connection-oriented protocol). It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.
- **Key Characteristics**
    - Reliability: Ensures data is delivered accurately and in order.
    - Flow Control: Manages the rate of data transmission to prevent congestion.
    - Error Detection and Correction: Detects errors in data transmission and corrects them.
    - Connection-Oriented: Establishes a connection before transmitting data and terminates it afterward.
- **TCP Handshake**
    
    The TCP handshake is a three-step process used to establish a connection between a client and a server. It ensures that both parties are ready to transmit data and establishes the initial sequence numbers for the communication.
    
    - SYN (Synchronize): The client sends a SYN packet to the server to initiate a connection. This packet includes an Initial Sequence Number (ISN).
    - SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge): The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the client's SYN packet by incrementing the client's ISN by one and sending its own ISN.
    - ACK (Acknowledge): The client sends an ACK packet back to the server, acknowledging the server's SYN-ACK packet by incrementing the server's ISN by one. The connection is now established, and data transfer can begin.

**2- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**  is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite, used for transmitting data with low latency. Unlike TCP, UDP is **connectionless** and does not guarantee the delivery, order, or integrity of the packets. Since UDP is connectionless, there is no handshake process like in TCP. Instead, data is sent as discrete packets, known as datagrams, with minimal interaction between the sender and receiver.

**UDP** is a fast, lightweight, connectionless protocol commonly used in applications where speed is critical, and the occasional loss of packets is acceptable. It transmits data without the overhead of establishing a connection, making it suitable for real-time applications like video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP.

For further reading, refer to the official IETF documentation on UDP.

**3- IP Protocol (Internet Protocol)** 

**IP** is a fundamental protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite that enables the routing of data packets between devices across interconnected networks, such as the Internet.

- **Key Characteristics**
    - Connectionless: IP is a connectionless protocol, meaning each packet (or datagram) is treated independently without establishing a dedicated end-to-end connection.
    - Packet-Switched: Data is sent in small units called packets, each containing both source and destination addresses.
    - Addressing: Utilizes IP addresses to identify the source and destination of data packets.
    - Routing: Employs routing algorithms to determine the optimal path for data transmission across networks.
- Versions
    - IPv4: The most widely used version, featuring a 32-bit address space (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - IPv6: The newer version with a 128-bit address space (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334) designed to overcome IPv4's limitations and support the growing number of internet-connected devices.

**4- DNS (Domain Name Service)**

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to translate human-readable domain names (like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

- **Key Characteristics**
    - Hierarchical Structure: Organized in a tree-like structure with domains at various levels (e.g., top-level domains like .com, second-level domains like example.com).
    - Decentralized: Distributed across many servers worldwide, ensuring robustness and availability.
    - Caching: Uses caching mechanisms to reduce the load on DNS servers and speed up responses.
- **Functions**
    - Name Resolution: Converts domain names to IP addresses.
    - Email Routing: Uses MX (Mail Exchange) records to direct email to mail servers.
    - Service Discovery: Locates services within a network using SRV (Service) records.
- **Port 53**: DNS typically uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for query resolution and occasionally TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for tasks like zone transfers.
- **DNS Query Process**
    - **Client Request**: A client (e.g., web browser) queries a DNS resolver to translate a domain name. first checking the browser cache (short time cache) and the nth eOS cache (TTL or time to live setting)
    - **Recursive Query**: The resolver may query multiple DNS servers recursively to resolve the domain name. (it would send to Recursive DNS server and then Root DNS Server)
    - **Authoritative Response**: The resolver contacts the authoritative DNS server for the domain and retrieves the IP address.
    - **Caching**: The resolver caches the result for future requests, speeding up subsequent queries.
- **Security Considerations**
    - **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning**: Attackers can corrupt the DNS cache, redirecting traffic to malicious sites. Mitigation includes DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions).
    - **DDoS Attacks**: DNS servers can be targets of Distributed Denial of Service attacks, disrupting internet services. Mitigation includes robust infrastructure and traffic filtering.

5- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

It is a protocol used to **translate private IP addresses on a local network into public IP addresses** that can be used on the Internet, and vice versa. Its main functions include:

1. **Address Translation**: Converts private IP addresses to public IP addresses and vice versa.
2. **IP Masquerading**: Allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.
3. **Security**: Acts as a basic firewall by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.

NAT doesn't have a specific port because it's a protocol that operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model, not at the transport layer (Layer 4) where ports are defined.

**6- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**

It is used for **managing and monitoring network devices and their functions.** Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: SNMP allows network administrators to monitor network-attached devices (like routers, switches, servers) for conditions that warrant administrative attention.
2. **Port**: SNMP typically uses UDP ports **161** (for SNMP agents/managed devices) and **162** (for SNMP traps/notifications).
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Authentication**: SNMP versions 1 and 2c use community strings for authentication, which are sent in plaintext and can be vulnerable to interception.
    - **Encryption**: SNMPv3 introduced encryption capabilities to secure data transmission, addressing the plaintext vulnerability of earlier versions.
    - **Access Control**: Proper configuration of access control lists (ACLs) is crucial to restrict SNMP access to authorized management systems.
    - **SNMP Traps**: SNMP traps can provide real-time notifications but should be carefully configured to avoid overload or misuse.

**7- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

It is used for **sending and receiving email between servers**. Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: SMTP is primarily used for transferring outgoing email messages from a sender's email client or server to a recipient's email server. It handles the transmission of email across networks.
2. **Port**: SMTP typically uses TCP **port 25**. For secure SMTP communications, SMTP over SSL/TLS can use **port 465** (deprecated) or port **587** (Submission).
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Encryption**: SMTP can transmit messages in plaintext, potentially exposing email contents. SMTP over SSL/TLS (**SMTPS**) encrypts communication between email servers, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
    - **Authentication**: SMTP servers may require authentication (e.g., using username and password) to prevent unauthorized use (open relay).
    - **SPAM**: SMTP is vulnerable to misuse for sending spam emails. Proper configuration (e.g., SMTP authentication, spam filters) helps mitigate this risk.
    - **Relaying**: SMTP servers should be configured to prevent unauthorized relaying, which can be exploited for spamming or other malicious activities.

In summary, SMTP is essential for email communication but requires careful configuration to ensure security and prevent abuse. Encryption, authentication, and anti-spam measures are critical for protecting email communication integrity and privacy.

**8- SMB (Server Message Block)** 

It is a network protocol used **for sharing files, printers, and other resources** between computers on a network. It operates primarily at the application layer of the OSI model. Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: SMB facilitates shared access to files, printers, and other resources between devices on a network. It allows for file and printer sharing, as well as communication between computers **running Windows operating systems**.
2. **Port**: SMB typically uses **TCP ports 445** (SMB over TCP) and **139** (NetBIOS session service). UDP port **137** (NetBIOS name service) and port 138 (NetBIOS datagram service) are also used for older implementations of SMB.
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Authentication**: SMB supports authentication mechanisms such as NTLM (NT LAN Manager) and Kerberos. Strong authentication mechanisms should be used to prevent unauthorized access.
    - **Encryption**: SMB versions 3.x and later support encryption of data during transmission (SMB encryption). This helps protect data confidentiality and integrity against eavesdropping and tampering.
    - **Access Control**: Proper configuration of access control lists (ACLs) on shared resources is crucial to restrict access to authorized users or groups.
    - **Vulnerabilities**: Historically, SMB implementations have been vulnerable to security issues such as remote code execution and information disclosure. Regular patching and updates are essential to mitigate these risks.

**9- FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

It is a standard network protocol used **for transferring files between a client and a server** on a computer network. Here's an overview of its key aspects:

1. **Function**: FTP allows users to upload and download files from a remote server. It supports basic file management operations such as renaming, deleting, and creating directories.
2. **Port**: FTP traditionally uses two TCP ports:
    - **Port 21**: Control port used for sending commands and receiving responses between the FTP client and server.
    - **Port 20**: Data port used for the actual transfer of files.
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Authentication**: FTP supports authentication using usernames and passwords. However, FTP sends login credentials in plaintext, making them vulnerable to interception. FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) are more secure alternatives that encrypt the authentication and data transfer process.
    - **Encryption**: FTP does not inherently encrypt data during transmission, exposing file contents to potential interception. FTPS (FTP Secure) adds SSL/TLS encryption to FTP connections, while SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) uses SSH encryption for secure file transfers.
    - **Data Integrity**: Without encryption, FTP data transfers are susceptible to tampering, potentially compromising data integrity.
    - **Firewall Considerations**: FTP uses separate ports for control and data transfer, which can pose challenges for firewall configurations, especially with passive FTP mode requiring a range of ports to be opened.

**10- Telnet (Telecommunication Protocol)**

Telnet is a network protocol **used for remote terminal access** to manage devices and servers over a network. Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: Telnet allows a user to remotely log in to and manage a device (such as a router, switch, or server) as if they were physically present at the device's console. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interactive communication.
2. **Port**: Telnet typically uses **TCP port 23** for communication between the client (local computer) and the server (remote device).
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Authentication**: Telnet sends login credentials (username and password) in plaintext, making them vulnerable to interception by network sniffing tools. This lack of encryption exposes sensitive information to potential attackers.
    - **Data Integrity**: Since Telnet does not encrypt data during transmission, any information sent (including commands, output, and credentials) can be intercepted and modified.
    - **Vulnerabilities**: Telnet is prone to various security vulnerabilities, including man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking, and unauthorized access due to weak authentication mechanisms and lack of encryption.
    - **Usage Recommendations**: Due to its inherent security risks, Telnet is generally discouraged for remote access over untrusted networks. Secure alternatives like SSH (Secure Shell) should be used instead, as SSH encrypts data transmissions and provides strong authentication methods.

**11- SSH (Secure Shell)**

It is a network protocol used **for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network**. Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: SSH provides a secure method for remote login, command execution, and file transfer between computers over a network. It encrypts all communications to protect against eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.
2. **Port**: SSH typically uses **TCP port 22** for communication between the client and the server.
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Encryption**: SSH uses strong encryption algorithms to protect data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data.
    - **Authentication**: SSH supports multiple authentication methods, including password-based authentication, public key authentication, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Public key authentication is more secure and is highly recommended.
    - **Integrity**: SSH ensures the integrity of the data by using cryptographic hash functions to detect any tampering or alterations during transmission.
    - **Forwarding**: SSH supports secure tunneling (port forwarding), allowing encrypted connections to other network services. This can help secure otherwise insecure protocols.
    - **Vulnerabilities**: While SSH is generally very secure, misconfiguration or outdated software can introduce vulnerabilities. It's crucial to keep SSH software up to date and follow best security practices.
    - **Best Practices**: Disable root login, use key-based authentication instead of passwords, change the default SSH port to a non-standard port to reduce automated attacks, and limit access using firewall rules and intrusion detection/prevention systems.

**12- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**

It is a network layer protocol used primarily **for diagnostic and error-reporting purposes within IP networks**. Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: ICMP is used to send error messages and operational information indicating the status of a network or its components. Common uses include the "ping" and "traceroute" utilities, which help diagnose network connectivity issues.
2. **Port**: **ICMP does not use ports like TCP or UDP protocols do**. Instead, it uses different message types and codes to perform its functions (As it is in Network layer).
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Flooding Attacks**: ICMP can be exploited in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, such as ICMP flood attacks, where an attacker overwhelms a target with a high volume of ICMP requests.
    - **Smurf Attacks**: In a smurf attack, an attacker sends ICMP Echo Request packets with a spoofed source address (the victim's address) to a broadcast address. This causes many devices on the network to send ICMP Echo Replies to the victim, overwhelming it.
    - **Reconnaissance**: ICMP can be used by attackers to map out networks and discover active devices and their configurations. Tools like ping and traceroute can help identify live hosts and network paths.
    - **Filtering**: To mitigate risks, many networks **filter ICMP traffic at firewalls and routers.** This can prevent certain types of ICMP messages (e.g., Echo Requests) from reaching internal networks, reducing the attack surface.
    - **Usage Restrictions**: While filtering ICMP can enhance security, it may also hinder legitimate network diagnostics and operations. Careful consideration and balanced configurations are needed to ensure network health while maintaining security.

**13- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) >> IP —> MAC**

It is a protocol used for **mapping an IP address to a physical MAC** (Media Access Control) address on a local area network. Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses, allowing communication between devices on a local network. When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it uses ARP to find the destination device's MAC address.
2. **Port**: ARP operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and does not use TCP or UDP ports. Instead, it uses Ethernet frames for communication.
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **ARP Spoofing/Poisoning**: Attackers can exploit ARP by sending fake ARP messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device (such as a gateway). This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where the attacker intercepts or modifies traffic between devices.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker can flood a network with fake ARP responses, causing network disruption and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
    - **Static ARP Entries**: To mitigate ARP spoofing, static ARP entries can be configured on critical devices, mapping specific IP addresses to MAC addresses permanently.
    - **ARP Inspection**: Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is a security feature available on some network switches that intercepts all ARP requests and responses and verifies them against a trusted database before allowing them onto the network.
    - **Monitoring and Detection**: Network monitoring tools can detect unusual ARP activity, such as frequent changes in MAC address mappings, indicating potential ARP spoofing attempts.

**14- IGMP (Internet Group Multicast Protocol)**

It is a communication protocol used **to manage the membership of Internet Protocol multicast groups.** It is used primarily by hosts and adjacent routers on IP networks to establish multicast group memberships. Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: IGMP allows devices to join and leave multicast groups, enabling efficient routing of multicast traffic (data intended for multiple destinations) only to networks where there are members of the multicast group.
2. **Port**: IGMP operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and does not use TCP or UDP ports. Instead, it uses IP protocol number 2 for communication.
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Multicast Flooding**: Without proper control, IGMP can be exploited to flood a network with multicast traffic, leading to congestion and potential Denial of Service (DoS) conditions.
    - **Unauthorized Group Membership**: Attackers can join multicast groups to intercept sensitive multicast traffic or disrupt the multicast service.
    - **IGMP Snooping**: Network switches with IGMP snooping capability can monitor IGMP traffic between hosts and routers and dynamically configure multicast forwarding to only those ports involved in the multicast session. This prevents unnecessary traffic on the network.
    - **Access Control**: Implementing access control lists (ACLs) can restrict which devices are allowed to join specific multicast groups, enhancing network security.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Configuring rate limits on IGMP traffic can prevent IGMP-based DoS attacks by limiting the rate at which IGMP membership reports and queries are processed.
    - **Monitoring and Logging**: Regularly monitoring and logging IGMP traffic can help detect and respond to suspicious activities, such as unauthorized multicast group memberships or unusual traffic patterns.

**15- RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**

It is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows users to connect to another computer over a network and interact with its desktop interface as if they were physically present at the remote machine. Here are its key aspects:

1. **Function**: RDP provides remote access to a computer's desktop environment, allowing users to control the remote machine, run applications, and manage files. It is commonly used for remote administration, technical support, and telecommuting.
2. **Port**: RDP typically uses **TCP port 3389** for communication between the client and the remote server.
3. **Security Considerations**:
    - **Encryption**: RDP supports encryption to protect the data transmitted between the client and server. By default, RDP uses 128-bit RC4 encryption, but stronger encryption methods can be configured.
    - **Authentication**: RDP offers multiple authentication methods, including network-level authentication (NLA), which requires users to authenticate before establishing a remote session. NLA helps protect against brute force attacks and unauthorized access.
    - **Vulnerabilities**: RDP has been the target of various security vulnerabilities, including exploits that allow for unauthorized access or remote code execution. Keeping RDP software up to date with the latest security patches is crucial.
    - **Brute Force Attacks**: Exposing RDP to the internet can lead to brute force attacks, where attackers try numerous username and password combinations to gain access. Strong passwords and account lockout policies are essential to mitigate this risk.
    - **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Attackers can use RDP to deploy remote access trojans, gaining control over a victim's machine without their knowledge. Monitoring for unusual RDP activity and using endpoint security solutions can help detect and prevent such threats.
    - **Firewall and VPN**: To enhance security, RDP access should be restricted through firewalls, allowing only trusted IP addresses. Using a VPN can add an extra layer of security by encrypting all traffic and restricting access to authorized users.
    - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implementing two-factor authentication for RDP adds an additional security layer, requiring users to provide a second form of verification in addition to their password.
    
    **17- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** 
    
    It is a network management protocol used to **automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.** Here are its key aspects:
    
    1. **Function**: DHCP automates the process of configuring devices on IP networks, assigning them IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS server addresses. This simplifies network management by reducing the need for manual configuration.
    2. **Port**: DHCP uses **UDP ports 67 and 68.** Port 67 is used by the DHCP server to listen for client requests, and port 68 is used by the DHCP client to receive responses from the server.
    3. **Security Considerations**:
        - **Unauthorized DHCP Servers (Rogue DHCP)**: Unauthorized DHCP servers can be set up by attackers to distribute incorrect network settings, redirect traffic, or launch man-in-the-middle attacks. Network administrators should use DHCP snooping and port security features on switches to mitigate this risk.
        - **IP Address Exhaustion**: An attacker can exhaust the pool of available IP addresses by sending numerous DHCP requests, potentially denying service to legitimate clients. Implementing DHCP snooping and rate limiting can help prevent this type of attack.
        - **DHCP Spoofing**: Attackers can send forged DHCP responses to clients, redirecting traffic through malicious gateways or DNS servers. Using DHCP snooping and secure dynamic updates can help detect and prevent spoofing.
        - **Confidentiality**: DHCP does not encrypt its messages, so information such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, and network configurations can be intercepted. Although DHCP traffic is usually confined to a local network, additional network security measures (e.g., VLANs, IPsec) can help protect sensitive information.
        - **Network Segmentation**: Segmenting the network and placing DHCP servers in secure, trusted zones can reduce the risk of attacks and contain potential security breaches.
- **What is Firewall**
    
    A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the Internet.
    
- **What are IDS, IPS, HIDS, NIDS and their differences**
    
    **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: A security system that monitors network or system activities for malicious actions or policy violations and alerts administrators.
    
    **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: Similar to IDS but can actively block or prevent detected threats in addition to alerting administrators.
    
    **HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System)**: Monitors and analyzes the internals of a computing system (like system calls, application logs, file-system modifications) to detect suspicious activity on that specific host.
    
    **NIDS (Network-based Intrusion Detection System)**: Monitors network traffic to detect suspicious activity across the entire network, analyzing packet data and flow.
    
    **Differences**:
    
    - **Detection vs. Prevention**: IDS only detects and alerts, while IPS can also take action to prevent the threat.
    - **Location**: HIDS operates on individual hosts, monitoring internal activity. NIDS operates at the network level, monitoring network traffic.
    - **Scope**: HIDS provides detailed monitoring of specific hosts. NIDS offers broader coverage of the entire network but with less granularity.

- **what are virus, Trojan virus, Worm, botnet and their differences**
    
    **Virus**: A malicious software program that attaches itself to legitimate files and replicates by modifying other programs and files. It requires user interaction to spread and execute.
    
    **Trojan Virus (Trojan Horse)**: A type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software to deceive users into installing it. Once installed, it can perform harmful actions such as data theft, system damage, or creating backdoors for other malware.
    
    **Worm**: A standalone malicious program that replicates itself to spread across networks without needing to attach to a host file. Worms exploit vulnerabilities to propagate and often cause network congestion and system disruptions.
    
    **Botnet**: A network of infected computers (bots) controlled remotely by an attacker (botmaster). Botnets are used to carry out coordinated attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), spamming, and data theft.
    
    **Differences**:
    
    - **Replication Method**: Viruses attach to files and need user action; worms self-replicate and spread independently.
    - **Disguise**: Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software, while viruses and worms do not.
    - **Network**: Botnets involve a network of infected devices controlled by an attacker, whereas viruses, worms, and Trojans typically operate individually.
    - **Dependency**: Viruses require host files to spread; worms do not. Trojans rely on deception to be installed, while botnets require initial malware to recruit bots.
